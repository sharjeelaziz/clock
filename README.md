Tetrahedrally Truncated Dodecahedron Clock
==================
A clock built using a Raspberry Pi, LED seven segment and dot matrix displays driven by MAX7219. The python code uses the excellent MAX7219 driver by Richard Hull https://github.com/rm-hull/max7219 and https://github.com/tadeck/onetimepass by Tom Jaskowski.

The code is simple and displays local/UTC time, and time-based one-time password for a 2-Step verification account.

Pre-requisites
--------------
Ensure that the SPI kernel driver is enabled:
```
pi@raspberrypi ~ $ dmesg | grep spi
[    6.164368] bcm2708_spi 20204000.spi: master is unqueued, this is deprecated
[    6.489381] bcm2708_spi 20204000.spi: SPI Controller at 0x20204000 (irq 80)
```
And that the devices are successfully installed in /dev:
```
pi@raspberrypi ~ $ ls -l /dev/spi*
crw-rw---T 1 root spi 153, 0 Dec 31  1969 /dev/spidev0.0
crw-rw---T 1 root spi 153, 1 Dec 31  1969 /dev/spidev0.1
```
Refer to http://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/spi/README.md if the devices do not appear before proceeding.

GPIO pin-outs
-------------
The breakout board has an two headers to allow daisy-chaining:

| Board Pin | Name | Remarks | RPi Pin | RPi Function |
|--------:|:-----|:--------|--------:|--------------|
| 1 | VCC | +5V Power | 2 | 5V0 |
| 2 | GND | Ground | 6 | GND |
| 3 | DIN | Data In | 19 | GPIO 10 (MOSI) |
| 4 | CS | Chip Select | 24 | GPIO 8 (SPI CS0) |
| 5 | CLK | Clock | 23 | GPIO 11 (SPI CLK) |

Case
----
The case is designed in SketchUp. Printed at ShapeWays in [White Strong & Flexible](https://www.shapeways.com/materials/strong-and-flexible-plastic?li=nav) material and is available at http://shpws.me/Im4Y
